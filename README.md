# App Functionality
## Additional Functionality
-	I want a feature where you can create preset sounds and name them – like “Rainy Group Travel”  that would play the “Main Track, Rain Ambience, Group Walking, Group Horse Walking”
-	A Row of buttons that can easily fade between the different ambiences.
-	Title should change based on the combination of sounds “Rain + Forest + Group Walk” will change the title from “Travel” to ” Rainy Forest” or some bs like that.
-	The sound should be able to pause.
-	The audio should be able to be controlled with my earphones maybe.
